# Simple-To-Do-app
It's a simple desktop-to-do app. It can store the input data even after exiting the app

I created two different versions for it for the stored input purpose. One of them store the input data in a text file the other one stores it in json file

This script creates an interactive To-Do List application using the GooeyPie library. Users can add, delete, and move tasks between 'To Do' and 'Done' lists. All tasks are stored in a JSON file, preserving their status even when the application is closed. Features include moving all tasks from the 'To Do' list to the 'Done' list at once, and clearing all tasks from the 'Done' list. Exceptions are handled to ensure the JSON file is correctly formatted and permissions are appropriate. The script demonstrates effective use of event-driven programming, file I/O operations, and Python's GUI libraries.
